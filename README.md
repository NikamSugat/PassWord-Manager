# Password Manager

## Overview
This Password Manager is a simple command-line script written in Bash. It provides basic functionality to manage passwords, allowing users to add new passwords, retrieve existing ones, open specific URLs, and exit the password manager.

## How It Works
- **Add a New Password:** Users can add a new password by providing a name, length, and specifying whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
  
- **Retrieve a Password:** Users can retrieve a previously added password by entering the password's name.

- **Open URL:** Users can open specific URLs related to the creator's profiles (LinkedIn, Gmail, TryHackMe, and TryHackMe Badge) in their default web browser.

- **Exit:** Allows users to exit the password manager.
